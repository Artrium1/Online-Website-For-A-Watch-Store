        <h1>TUDOR HISTORY
        TUDOR AND THE FRENCH NAVY</h1>
        <p>TUDOR is celebrating its rich naval heritage by announcing a new partnership with the 
            French Navy, an opportunity to look back on several generations of professional diving watches.

                In 1954, with the creation of its first diver's watch, the Oyster Prince Submariner, 
                TUDOR began offering a new time keeping solution for the growing community of professional 
                scuba divers. The brand, a pioneer in the field of diving watches proposed a high-performance 
                instrument, that was reliable as well as robust, at an affordable price.

        <h1>1956 - REFERENCES 7922/7923</h1>
        <p>TUDOR's special relationship with the French Navy dates back to the beginning of 1956 
            when the Toulon-based Underwater Study and Research Group or Groupement d'Étude et 
            de Recherches Sous-Marines (G.E.R.S.) in French received Oyster Prince Submariner watches 
            for evaluation. These were examples of references 7922 and 7923, both water resistant to 100 
            meters and equipped with automatic and manual movements respectively. The water resistance of 
            these watches was deemed "perfect" and the functioning "completely correct" in a letter by the
             Commander of the G.E.R.S. of the time.
        </p>
        <h1>1958 - REFERENCE 7924</h1>
        <p>
            Convinced of the potential of the watches offered by the Geneva brand, he placed a new order for
            watches that were water-resistant to 200 meters. This led, at the end of the 1950s, to the birth
            of the famous TUDOR Submariner reference 7924, recognizable by its large, oversized crown, known
            by collectors as the “Big Crown”. This watch remains TUDOR's most iconic diver's watch today.
        </p>
        <img src="1tudor.jpg" id="img1" >
        <h1>1959 - REFERENCE 7928</h1>
        <p>TUDOR diving watches continued to evolve rapidly during the formative years of diving and in 1959, 
            with the reference 7928, the brand introduced crown guards, two steel shoulders forming part of the 
            case of the watch and which protected the main weak point of the watch from shocks. The French Navy 
            adopted this new watch as soon as the first examples were available, the now famous "Square Crown 
            Guards". Several executions of the reference 7928 followed and all were used by Marine Nationale divers.
        </p>
        <h1>1969 - REFERENCE 7016</h1>
        <p>In 1969, the reference 7016 introduced a new aesthetic in the brand's range that became the signature 
            of TUDOR diving watches. A combination of square indexes, painted with luminous material, and angular
            hands later nicknamed "Snowflake" by collectors because of the similarity to the form of a snowflake.
            This new design allowed for more luminous material to be applied to the dials and hands, thus resulting 
            in a longer duration of illumination, a key improvement for the French Navy divers. In 1974, the reference 
            7016 was also the first TUDOR diving watch to bear the famous “TUDOR M.N.” engravings. Composed of the 
            initials M.N. and the year of issue in numbers, these markings have reached close to iconic status and are 
            sought after relentlessly by collectors of military watches.</p>
            <img src="2tudor.jpg" id="img2" >
        <h1>1975 - REFERENCE 9401</h1>
        <p>The most famous TUDOR diving watch used by the French Navy was the reference 9401, with its combination of
            blue dial and bezel, often referred to as “TUDOR blue”. These watches were also engraved with the initials
            MN followed by the year of issue on the back and delivered in two configurations, “Snowflake” and later with
            triangular indexes. This model remained in production and was delivered to the French Navy until the 1980s,
            but the watches' use extended into the 2000s, especially at the French Navy diving school and amongst combat
            swimmers. Although officially decommissioned fifteen years ago, Tudor MNs are seen sometimes still today on
           the wrists of reservists and veteran servicemen alike.
        </p>

        <h1>THE FABRIC STRAP</h1>
        <p>The watches ordered by the French Navy were typically ordered without a metal bracelet and were worn instead on 
            fabric straps. Two types seem to have been particularly utilized by divers and combat swimmers; black braided 
            nylon straps and, more rarely and handcrafted bracelets made from elastic bands recycled from French-issue parachutes,
            recognizable by their green color and their central thread of either yellow or red.

            TUDOR watches formerly used by the French Navy are particularly sought after by collectors, as they embody
            the very concept of the tool watch. Robust, essential items of equipment, with their blue dials and bezels
            washed out by salt water and the sun, they evoke the daring of a life of adventure under the surface of the
            five oceans. Today, the TUDOR collection perpetuates this heritage through its lines of diving watches, Black 
            Bay and Pelagos.</p>
