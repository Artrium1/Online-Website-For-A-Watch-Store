        <h1>1860 through 1880s</h1>
        <p>In 1860 Edouard Heuer founded Uhrenmanufaktur Heuer AG (English: Heuer Watchmaking Inc.) in St-Imier, Switzerland.

            Edouard Heuer patented his first chronograph in 1882 and in 1887 patented an "oscillating pinion" still used by major watchmakers of mechanical chronographs</p>
        
        <h1>1910s</h1>
        <p>In 1911, Heuer received a patent for the "Time of Trip", the first dashboard chronograph. Designed for use in automobiles 
            and aircraft, two large hands mounted from the center pinion indicate the time of day, as on a traditional clock. A small
             pair of hands mounted at the top of the dial (12 o'clock position) indicates the duration of the trip (up to 12 hours).
              A top-mounted crown allows the user to set the time; a button mounted in that crown operates the start/stop/reset functions
               of the "duration of trip" counter.

            Heuer introduced its first wrist chronograph in 1914. The crown was at the 12 o'clock position, as these first wrist
            chronographs were adapted from pocket chronographs. In 1916 Edward Heuer's son, Charles-Auguste, introduced the "Mikrograph",
            the first stopwatch accurate to 1/100 of a second. This model was soon followed by the "Semikrograph", a 
            stopwatch that offered 1/50 of a second timing, as well as a split-second function (which allows the user to determine
            the interval between two contestants or events).</p>
        <img src="1tag.jpg" id="img1">
        <h1>1930s and 1940s</h1>
        <p>In 1933, Heuer introduced the "Autavia", a dashboard timer used for automobiles and aviation (whence its name, from "AUTos" and
            "AVIAtion"). The companion "Hervue" was a clock that could run for eight days without being wound. Over the period from 1935
            through the early 1940s, Heuer manufactured chronographs for pilots in the Luftwaffe, known as "Flieger" (pilot) chronographs.
            The earlier version featured a hinged-back case and one pusher (for start/stop/reset); the later version had a snap-back case
            and added a second pusher (for time-in and time-out). All these Flieger chronographs had two-registers, with a capacity of 30
            minutes."[5]

            In the mid-1940s, Heuer expanded its line of chronographs to include two- and three-register models and a three-register
            chronograph that had a full calendar function (day/date/month). As the highest development of Heuer's chronographs, these
            "triple calendar" chronographs came in stainless steel and 14, 18, and 22 karat gold cases. Dial colors were white, black,
            or copper.</p>

        <h1>1950s</h1>
        <p>In the early-1950s, Heuer produced watches for the American retailer Abercrombie & Fitch. The "Seafarer" and "Auto-Graph" were
            chronographs produced by Heuer to be sold by Abercrombie & Fitch. The "Seafarers" had special dials—with blue, green, and yellow
            patterns—that showed the high and low tides. This dial could also be used to track the phases of the moon. Heuer produced a version 
            of the "Seafarer" for sale under the Heuer name, with this model called the "Mareographe". Heuer produced the "Auto-Graph" in 1953 
            and 1954, which featured a tachymeter scale on the dial and a hand that could be preset to a specific point on the scale. This 
            complication allowed a rally driver or navigator to determine whether the car achieved the desired pace over a measured mile. 
            Advertisements and literature also pointed out that this hand could be rotated to count golf scores or other events.[6]</p>
